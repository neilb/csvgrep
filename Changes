    - Added a --match-column / -mc option, which says that the pattern
      should only be applied to a specific column, rather than the whole line.

    - The count of lines had an off-by-one error, as it was including
      the header line. Thanks to Scott Baker for catching this.
    - Put the shebang line back to #!perl, as ExtUtils::MakeMaker
      doesn't currently fix "#!/usr/bin/env perl" on installation.
